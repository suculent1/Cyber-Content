This folder's focus will be on:
- Symmetric cryptography, namely block ciphers, hash functions, and message authentication codes
- Asymmetric cryptography, namely RSA and Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange.  Combined with symmetric encryption, this makes a powerful combination for securing communications. Applications of these technologies will be explored by deploying SSL and SSH solutions.
- Tools for implementing cryptographic algorithms(OpenSSL), as well as tools for attacking and defending protocols that use encryption.
